<span class="title-prefix">10.7</span> Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch10_s07_p01">In this chapter, we have discussed the concept of lock-in and identified various issues on the lock-in such as how companies can achieve it, the downside of it, and the lock-in index for practical use. We also have addressed the relationship between the lock-in and companiesâ€™ absorptive capacity within the framework of outsourcing. The key points are the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch10_s07_l01">
        <li>Lock-in is pervasive. It is part of the normal day-to-day transactions in business. </li>
        <li>If you are a producer, then you need to take steps to acquire customers so that you can lock them in (see <a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch10_s07_f01">Figure 10.3 "Lock-In Issues"</a>). This may include giving potential customers money, providing additional complimentary services, and developing attractive incentives for participation. </li>
        <li>Producers will always try to lock-in consumers. It is important that consumers try to get producers to offer incentives in order to offset present and future switching costs. </li>
        <li>The initial stage of bargaining is important because once the consumer has committed to a seller, then the lock-in has been cast. If you are a business and are considering outsourcing, then you will be locked-in as soon as you sign on the dotted line. In that case, you should look for second sources.</li>
        <li>When a company or an individual outsources, they are essentially merging with another entity that has a competitive advantage in a particular area. Identifying the processes where having a core competency is critical for the firm to survive and to engage in learn-by-doing activity in that area. </li>
    </ul>
