<span class="title-prefix">13.1</span> Building-the-Business Phase</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch13_s01_p02">Once the business model has been created and the business plan has been developed, the hard work begins. In most situations, everything is new and needs to be built up from scratch. The entire supply chain has to be built and tested to insure that orders for products and services can be accepted, filled, and supported. This is the <em class="emphasis">Building-the-Business</em> phase and it is vital to a successful business launch. As illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch13_s01_n01">Note 13.1 "Key Business Questions Before Launch"</a>, several key business questions must be answered before launching the business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch13_s01_p03">The hard part is to install initial processes or systems to make the business work, and that is where project management is essential. We use the term <em class="emphasis">project management system</em> loosely, since in many instances the system can be self-contained and organized in the mind of the entrepreneur. Nevertheless, the hard part involves building the business to produce the product and deliver the service. This requires project management. Even if you have plans for manufacturing, marketing, and distributing the product, you still need to have a process to accomplish or execute the plan.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch13_s01_p04">In many instances, entrepreneurs turn to turnkey systems for accounting and inventory management. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Turnkey systems</a><span class="glossdef">Ready-to-go-software, ready-to-go-processes, or both for running a business.</span></span> are ready-to-go-software, ready-to-go-processes, or both for running a business. Time and effort is still needed to identify the turnkey solution and then more time and effort is required to actually implement it. Some sort of mechanism is necessary for determining what solution fits the business, how the system will be implemented, who will operate the system, and how it fits in with the other business activities. Even if the so-called turnkey solutions have been identified for accounting and inventory management, additional planning is needed for implementing and creating business processes for installing and running the system.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch13_s01_p07">Even the simplest start-up company has to accomplish the functions described above in some capacity. These systems may be in the mind of the entrepreneur and also executed by the entrepreneur, but they are still necessary for survival. There are other system processes that need to be in place as illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch13_s01_f02">Figure 13.2 "Systems Emerging Over Time"</a>. These systems or functions typically emerge and evolve as the business grows and prospers. A good way to consider the complexity of a large business is to think about the components of the supply chain. This is again illustrated in <a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch13_s01_f03">Figure 13.3 "Large Organizations Need Many Systems and Structures"</a> where a number of critical processes need to be in place for a large and growing supply chain. In larger organizations, these activities are part of a more formal approach. The formal approach is project management. If a business only has one employee, the entrepreneur, then all the systems will be conceptualized and executed by the entrepreneur. However, even in a small, one-person operation, understanding and implementing some type of project management is necessary in order to deal with the complexity of the start-up process. Just having a checklist of things to do and things that have been accomplished will help in dealing with the overwhelming complexity of launching a start-up.</p>
