<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 7</span> Conceptualizing Products/Services Using FAD</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_p01">The previous chapters have focused on learning the basic concepts related to product differentiation in the context of monopolistic competition. The focus of this chapter is learning-by-doing. We will use techniques to help transform a nagging idea about a new product to be more explicit and real. The tool for completing this task is called the FAD (features, attributes, and design) template. The FAD template is used to identify the features and attributes that can be used for product and service differentiation. The first part of the chapter will introduce the key concepts necessary to understand and motivate the use of the FAD template. The FAD template will then be introduced and used to demonstrate and structure the development of important attributes and features of a new product or service. </p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s01_p01">Here are some definitions and concepts that can be used to understand how products and services can be differentiated:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s01_l01">

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s01_p02">A very simple way to view all the above is that features, function, form, design, and meaning are all attributes, with different levels of information about a product. Consider the SuperDuper smartphone in <a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch07_s01_f01">Figure 7.1 "SuperDuper Smartphone"</a>. The SuperDuper phone has a keypad (attribute, feature, function, and form), with lighted square keys (attribute, feature, and form), and a high color indestructible screen (attribute, feature, and form) with a black onyx color and coarse texture (attributes, features, and form), which can be used for calling and texting (attributes, features and functions), listening to stereo music (attribute, feature, and function), and locating friends within 1 mile (attribute, feature and function). This smart and futuristic SuperDuper phone (attribute and overall design) creates feelings of connectedness, comfort, and security (attributes and meanings). </p>

<span class="title-prefix">7.2</span> Meaning and Product Design</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p01">There are three fundamental approaches to design (<a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_f01">Figure 7.2 "Fundamental Design Approaches"</a>). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">user-driven design (UDD)</a><span class="glossdef">Design approach focused on researching consumer wants and needs.</span></span> school is focused on researching consumer wants and needs. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">technology-driven design (TDD)</a><span class="glossdef">Design approach focused applying new and emerging technologies to develop products and services.</span></span> school is not a school per se, but rather an approach that is focused on applying new and emerging technologies to develop products and services.

Most products can be designed using all three approaches, for example, software, custom houses, furnishings, electronics, clothes, personal care, appliances, and transportation. Some products such as CPUs’ semiconductors and nanotechnology and health equipment are primarily technology driven. </p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p02">MDD also involves UDD, but it is not the motivation behind the entire process. In MDD, the company executives and research and development (R&amp;D) personnel design the next-generation product and then present it to consumers. They still obtain a reaction from potential consumers, but it is not the sole driving force behind the process. The MDD approach also incorporates technology-push innovation, where innovative emerging technologies are pushed to the market. In essence, MDD uses elements of both UDD and TDD to deliver innovative products. The unique part of MDD is the search for meaning. There is a search for meaning in the way that people relate to objects. This is often accomplished by collaborating with other organizations and with experts in the product domain on how the product should be designed. The design of the product is not solely derived from customer pull as is the case of UDD, but is also driven by the innovator and new and emerging technologies. In MDD, the innovator synthesizes information from a variety of sources and then uses this knowledge to design innovative products.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_001">Software developers often use a technique referred to as user-centered design or participative design that has elements of UDD and MDD. In user-centered design, there is an iterative process of building the application and having the user continuously validate software solution.</span> </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p03">The idea behind the MDD School of innovation is to look for meaning in everyday products and to try to determine how they can be changed in a radical way to support the emotional and psychological needs of consumers. The MDD approach to developing a Blue Ocean market involves understanding how customers relate to products and then developing new products that get at the core of what meaning customers attach to products.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_002">As noted in an earlier chapter. A Blue Ocean market is a market that is not in existence. A Blue Ocean product is a new product that is radically differentiated from existing products that are being offered.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p04">Many individuals in the MDD school believe that the user-centered design is a hindrance to developing radical innovations.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_003">Cf. Verganti (2009).</span> The focus of the MDDapproach is to find the meaning in the way people relate to objects in their everyday life. The MDD school of innovation not only contemplates beauty and form, but also examines the emotional and psychological relationships that people have with things, objects, and products. Proponents of MDD believe that developing innovative ideas that transcend existing product concepts requires more than just attending to product differentiation. Since the MDD school of innovation uses a push strategy. Product ideas are conceived as a vision and offered to consumers as a proposal. As noted by Verganti: “These proposals are not dreams without a foundation. These proposals eventually emerge as the products users were actually looking for. They end-up being what people were waiting for—and thus are great marketing successes” (p. 116). </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p05">We alluded to the fundamental meaning of product in the earlier discussion of the basic functions of products. There are many different types of meanings that can be attached to products, some of them are tangible and some of them are complex and elusive. Key areas of meaning include the following: provide physical and emotional sustenance; facilitate control over the environment; provide entertainment; provide feelings of status, superiority, and elitism; provide a sense of stewardship; provide a sense of altruism; provide feelings of adventure; provide security and comfort; facilitate the completion of some work or home task; provide familial support; support learning and adaptation; help us to change location; provide opportunity for communication and networking; provide for respect and recognition; and, of course, be a source of satisfaction and happiness. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p06">Traditional user-centered design approaches are not focused on understanding the meaning of the relationship that people have with objects. The Wii is not a game machine, it is the campfire surrounded by family and friends. Embedding diamonds in wireless phones contributes little to the calling function. But in some people’s minds, diamonds are a symbol of affluence and sophistication and are used to convey that image. The iPhone is not just a phone and the iTouch is not just an MP3 player, they are status symbols that also provide comfort and social networking. A Cirque du Soleil performance is not just a circus or just entertainment, it is a risky adventure in an ethereal world never seen before. The iPad is not a replacement for a netbook or a laptop, it is the adventurer’s guide to the galaxy of knowledge and entertainment. It is the present day <em class="emphasis">Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy</em>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p07">Attaching meaning to objects is of course somewhat subjective and strongly influenced by the researcher’s background and by social mores. There are numerous types of meaning that can be examined and they are often interdependent. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p08">Designing products that draw on meaning requires creativity and hard work. Creativity can be cultivated and is within the grasp of most people as discussed in <a class="xref" href="sanders_1.0-ch06#sanders_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "Facilitating Creativity and Innovation"</a>. The hard work is the never-ending process of determining the proper ingredients that go into the secret sauce to keep people from becoming bored or even worse, ignoring your product.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p09">A key part of the MDD process involves partnering with interpreters. This partnering involves both learning-about and learning-by-doing. The interpreters are the organizations and individuals who are working on products that are similar to the products that you are examining. They can be suppliers and component manufactures, consultants, consumers, competitors, universities, research firms and think tanks, trade association and publications, research conferences, and of course one of the most important interpreters, the search engine. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p10">There are other approaches to design that focus on marketing, project management, product management, portfolio management, product engineering, creativity, and controlling the process. Later chapters will discuss the role of project management, new product development and portfolio management in providing structure to the innovation process. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p11">Many companies use hybrid approaches that draw on UDD, TDD, and MDD. Our focus in this chapter is primarily on MDD. But we also rely on user-centered design for refining products and making them usable. Even Apple, who we believe is the wunderkind of MDD in the USA, listens to their customers. For example, they redesigned Apple TV to become an inexpensive video-streaming device and put buttons on the smallest shuffle because consumers did not like having all the music control buttons on the ear bud cord.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_004">Lyons (2010b, September 1).</span> UDD is also very important for software development, whether it be in the context of game development, applications development, or social networking applications. A customer-centric agile development process is essential for delivering products that will be used. Ergonomics, ergonomics laboratories, and usability research are the foundation for delivering high-quality software products to the consumers. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s02_p12">There is one more design strategy that can be linked to many product failures. It is a purely functional design strategy that does not incorporate user needs or meaning at all. There is little if any UDD or MDD. This situation occurs where someone thinks that there is a need or demand for a product or service, but the end-users were not listened to or were ignored completely. This often occurs when there is no need or demand for a product or service, but someone thought that it would be a good idea to develop it anyway. I was involved with such a product when I worked as a programmer. Here is the story.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">7.3</span> Functional Design and User Ignored</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s03_p01">Barlow was the head of our IT group and he was also the head scorekeeper for the plant’s golf league. Every Monday morning Barlow would take the golf scores from the past week of play and compute the league standings as well as calculate the handicaps. Barlow had been doing this for years. Someone in human resources thought that he was spending too much time on the league and they also thought it was a burden to Barlow. So HR commissioned a golf handicapping and league scoring system. A complete cost–benefit analysis was actually implemented and the payback was deemed acceptable, so the green light was given to the project. A team of analysts and programmers were assigned to gather requirements and implement the system. Tens of thousands of dollars were spent developing and programming the system. The system was used just a couple of times. It was a pain to use, the results were incorrect, and most importantly, Barlow could finish his calculations faster than it would take to key-in the data and generate the reports. Barlow actually liked his manual system and took pride in his ability to produce weekly updates in a few hours. He said as such, in quiet tones, but he was not listened to.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s03_p02">In the current market context, functionally designed products and services are sometimes at risk, unless the meaning of the design is to convey simplicity and functionality. There are numerous examples of successful products and services that simply do what they are supposed to do, because they are functional. Functionally designed products can be even more successful when they are accompanied by user-centered design and meaning-centered design. </p>

<span class="title-prefix">7.4</span> Identifying Key Meanings, Attributes, and Features</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s04_p01">One thing is for sure. There are literally thousands of attributes, features, designs, and meanings that can be used to define products and services. This section details the major attributes that should be considered during product and service development. </p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s04_l01">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Functions of the product or service and target customers</em>. What does the product do? What important subfunctions does it perform? What type of customers or customer segment are you trying to attract?</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Quality</em>. How well does the product or service conform to specifications? Does the product or service do what it says it is supposed to do in the user manual? Is it effective in performing its function?</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Reliability</em>. Does the product or service perform as it is supposed to over the expected life of the product or service. Is it prone to failure? Is it easily maintained? Can parts be obtained at a reasonable cost and are they easy to change? Does the product perform satisfactorily in a variety of environmental conditions? </li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Ease-of-use</em>. Is the product or service easy to use and can consumers learn how to use it without much trouble? Is the product convenient to use? A convenient product or service is readily available, performs the task for which it was designed, and reduces the time it takes to complete a task.</li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Performance</em>. Is the product smaller than the competition? Is it more powerful? Does the product or service complete a task faster? Is the product adaptable to many situations? </li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Design</em>. Is the external form attractive? Is the product packaged properly? Does the product suggest a certain meaning? Do the materials used in developing a product also contribute to the overall look and feel? Thus, the meaning of a product is derived from the type and color of the material used to construct a product, the texture and feel of the product, the size, the product name, and from the overall form or style of the product or service.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_005">Verganti (2009).</span> Examples of abstract design meanings might include: futuristic, scary, hallow, delicate, intellectual, feminine, masculine, macho, healthy, psychedelic, smart, fashionable, earthy, retro, metal, avant-garde, youthful, personal, worldly, mature, luxurious, elite, western, oriental, simple, sassy, cool, organic, green, and even abstract.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s04_p02">Design attractiveness and innovation also applies to services. Packaging for a service includes the overall look and feel of the service. It is the gestalt or form and configuration of the service as perceived by the consumer. The key success indicator for a service is the customer’s perception of the overall experience with the service process.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_006">Bitner, Ostrom, and Morgan (2008).</span> </p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s04_l02">
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Technology</em>. Is there an emerging technology or a process that can improve the quality, reliability ease-of-use, performance, value, design, and meaning of the product? </li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Value creation</em>. Is there any intrinsic value in the product that significantly distinguishes it from other products or services offered by your company or the competition? Does the product or service solve a problem that consumers want to solve and will the solution attract them to the product or service? </li>
        <li>
<em class="emphasis">Meaning</em>. The meaning of a product or service can be thought of as super-attribute or super-feature that nurtures the inner needs of the individual. Meaning can include the following: provides physical, health, religious, or emotional sustenance; provides feelings of being needed or being listened to; supports artistic and creative needs; facilitates control over the environment; supports feelings of closeness to the earth and being organic; provides entertainment; supports feelings of status, superiority, and elitism; provides a sense of stewardship or a sense of altruism; supports feelings of adventure; supports gender needs; supports feelings of security and comfort; facilitates and assists in the completion of some work or home task; provides feelings of familial support; helps an individual or a community to learn and adapt; helps us to change location; provides an opportunity for communication and networking; has above-average intrinsic value to some or many people; provide for respect and recognition; and finally, provides a source of satisfaction, happiness, or hope. The meaning of a product or service is very much tied-in to what the product does. For example, communicating is one of the most important and ongoing functions in our lives and we attach significant meaning to products and services that support communication.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="section" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Overlap in Meanings, Attributes, and Features </h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s04_s01_p01">After reading through the list, you can probably notice that there is a significant amount of overlap among the different attribute categories. This is in part related to the imprecision of words in all languages and to the proliferation of synonyms. A Venn diagram illustrating the relationships among words and their meanings would visually depict significant degrees of overlap. This ties in very well with the concept of a brand and MDD. Recall that a brand is simply something that lives in the head of consumers.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_007">Adamson (2006).</span> A brand is simply a composite of the mental associations that are generated when you see or think about a certain product. Another way to think about branding is as a gestalt view of the product. It is more than the sum of its parts (the attributes, features, functions, form, design, and meaning). It is the meaning we attach to the product and all the neural associations that are invoked when the product or service is recalled. </p>

<span class="title-prefix">7.5</span> Design Products and Services that Facilitate Control</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s05_p01">A fundamental force of adaptation in human beings is our attempt to control the environment.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_008">Cf. Jo, Moon, Garrity, and Sanders (2007).</span> Infants try to get control of their environment by crying. Cuteness is a built-in genetic adaptation that augments crying and also facilitates environmental control. As we age, this strategy does not work very well and people control the environment by fitting-in, which is another type of control. Security, freedom, independence, and emancipation are the rewards of obtaining control. Getting wheels and driving, acquiring a secure and comfortable home, obtaining a job, and achieving financial security are milestones in achieving control. One person’s gain in control can sometimes lead to a loss of control by another. This is the collateral damage that can occur when someone gains too much control over others. For example, colleagues, family, and friends can facilitate (or hinder) the drive for environmental control. However, that same individual can in turn use the control to dominate those who helped him or her to achieve environmental control. Many individual and group conflicts can be traced to someone seeking excessive control or to someone else seeking emancipation from the excessive control.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s05_p02">The two fundamental strategies used to control the environment are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">primary control</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when an individual tries to directly engage with and change the external environment to fit his or her needs and wishes.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">secondary control</a><span class="glossdef">A type of control directed at changing the self to cope with the environment.</span></span>. Primary control occurs when an individual tries to directly engage with and change the external environment to fit his or her needs and wishes.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_009">Heckhausen and Schulz (1995); Skinner (1996).</span> Secondary control is a type of control that is directed at changing the self in order to cope with the environment. Secondary control is a goal-directed coping strategy for minimizing losses in primary control and also a mechanism for maintaining and increasing primary control. Individuals that do not engage in primary or secondary control have relinquished control and this is manifested by passivity and helplessness. Individuals engaging in primary control try to fix the environment, and those engaged in secondary control try to adapt to the environment. Both strategies assist in coping with the stress and complexity that are part of the everyday activities in the external environment. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s05_p03">We have found that primary and secondary controls also influence feelings of psychological ownership an individual has towards his or her avatar in an online game.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_010">Jo et al. (2011).</span> Psychological ownership occurs when people have feelings of ownership towards material things or tangible objects and even immaterial or intangible objects.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_011">Pierce, Kostovab, and Dirks (2003).</span> It occurs when an individual views the object as <em class="emphasis">mine. </em>We have found that the key to obtaining lock-in in online gaming environments is to get game players to embrace the system as though they own it. This ownership is the direct result of being able to exercise both primary and secondary controls over their online character by way of the user interface and by successfully interacting with members of the online guilds.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s05_p04">Facebook is a very interesting case of using systems to gain environmental control. It is very difficult for people to actually brag about their day-to-day accomplishments and activities in the <em class="emphasis">real world</em> or nononline world. It is much easier, and is indeed acceptable, in Facebook interactions to talk about oneself. There are several mechanisms built into Facebook that encourage bragging. For example, if a picture is added to the photo library or is used to display the image on the Facebook profile, then it is acceptable to brag or tout one’s stuff on the accomplishment or the activity. Facebook permits people to control what is known and what is not known about them. It also opens up new lines of communication and it can sometimes alleviate loneliness and even increase recognition and status. LinkedIn is the social networking tool of choice for bragging about professional accomplishments and looking for a job, while Twitter is the outlet of choice for serial braggers and businesses that want to obtain exposure.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s05_p05">The bottom line is that if people can control a product or service or if a product or service helps to actually control the world, people will feel that they own the artifact and thus become locked-in to using that product or service out of loyalty. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s05_p06">There are of course issues of having too much control and having too many options. There is some evidence that having too many choices leads to decision paralysis and some people believe that having too many choices contributes to depression.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_012">Schwartz (2003).</span> Novice users of any product or service need directed guidance. A wireless phone or a DVR needs to be easy to use for the first-time user, but also readily customizable as experience grows and new features are sought.</p>

Some product features were not even available last year, but they are mandatory today. Similarly, product designs and their accompanying meanings are constantly in flux. The importance of product attributes changes. The following classification scheme can be used to ascertain whether attributes and features are increasing or declining in importance. The classification scheme was derived from a variety of sources.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_013">Iyer and Muncy (2005); Keller, Sternthal, and Tybout (2002); Keller and Tybout (2002); Kim and Mauborgne (2005); McGrath and MacMillan (2000); Tybout and Sternthal (2005).</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s06_s01_p01">These are attributes that most of the products in a category usually have. They are the basic features found in a product or service. They help to define the prototypical product. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">product</a><span class="glossdef">Something that is tangible, does something, and has a function.</span></span> is something that is tangible and it does something and has a function.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_014">Adamson (2006).</span> For example, it provides sustenance; it provides security and comfort; it helps us to complete some task; it helps us to learn and adapt; and it helps us to change location, communicate, and network. The product should do what it is meant to do, with certain features that are compelling and functional. These features with their accompanying functionality are “must-haves” for a product or service to be minimally acceptable, and preferably strongly desired. If a product does not possess these essential features and functionality, it might be eliminated from consideration. For example, an auto global positioning system (GPS) should have the ability to enter an address and display how long it will take to get to a location; a word processor should have spell-checking capabilities; and a movie theater should sell treats.<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"></a><span class="glossdef">The attributes that most products in a category usually have.</span></span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s06_s02_p01">These are the attributes of a product or service that assist in distinguishing products from the competition and from similar models in a product line. Product and service features that are differentiators are usually derived from Midas products and are high-end products. They are for nonprice-sensitive consumers. You can think of the demand curve as a steep incline where product features roll down from Midas products to Atlas products. When costs are further driven down, the features become the standard of Hermes products. Hermes products are for price-sensitive consumers. Important differentiators for auto GPSs include Bluetooth capability, voice recognition, and topography maps. A movie theater could have very comfortable seats. A word processor could have voice control. As noted earlier, the features tend to roll down the demand curve and the differentiators become must-haves over time.<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"></a><span class="glossdef">Attributes of a product or service that assist in distinguishing products from the competition and from similar models in a product line.</span></span></p>

BOFs have the potential to deliver a knockout punch by developing a Blue Ocean market, a brand new uncontested marketplace. In general, BOF features are in their infancy—beginning to unfold and emerge. Examples for auto GPS might include location of friends and family in close proximity.<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"></a><span class="glossdef">Features typically in the very early stages of R&amp;D and part of a secret plan to develop a new market.</span></span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s06_s03_p02">Another way to identify exciters or BOFs is to think about ways you could go about putting your company out of business or for that matter any company out of business. These are nightmare features and technologies. Many of the ideas that have contributed to putting companies, industries, and even countries out of business were derived from radical technological innovation. Examples include the printing press; armaments and tactical innovations; and networking, computing, and communications innovations. These so-called disruptive technologies are product or process innovations that eventually eclipse or overturn the existing dominant technology. Disruptive technologies can lead to sunrise features and to sunrise products. Sunrise features and products are the dawn of new technological and conceptual capabilities. </p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s06_s04_p01">These are attributes that are no longer necessary or on the verge of becoming extinct. They are sunset features. They are features that are on the verge of becoming obsolete and fading into darkness and oblivion. Sometimes EXTs cannot be removed because there may be a small subset of people that demand the feature. In this case, a decision has to be made to abandon the features or keep the feature. Sometimes the decision to abandon is the best way to go because of cost issues and because the company is going down a new technology path. This was the case with recent versions of Microsoft’s operating systems that abandoned some of the legacy DOS code. Apple made a similar decision in regards to abandoning DVD drives in the MacBook Air product and the decision not to include a camera in the iTouch. All of Apple’s decisions are influenced by product positioning, product costs, and the emergence and decline of technologies.<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"></a><span class="glossdef">Attributes that are no longer necessary or on the verge of becoming extinct.</span></span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dissatifiers (DISs)</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s06_s05_p01">There are instances when products and features in existing products can discourage consumers from using your product or your competitor’s products. Sometimes features can actually cause consumers to actually avoid using a product. The feature may be a negative attribute of the product. This can occur because the product or service has not been designed correctly and is basically unusable. Numerous products and services have failed because consumers have been dissatified with the design. Consumers can also be dissatified with a product because the consumer does not want the feature in the product or service. DISs are often sunset features. For example, many people did not attend circuses because they were opposed to the use of wild animals in the shows or because they thought that the animals were not interesting. That is one of many reasons why Cirque du Soleil became popular with a larger adult market. Cirque du Soleil simply abandoned the use of animals in their programs.<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm"></a><span class="glossdef">Instances when products and features in existing products can discourage consumers from using a product or competitor’s products.</span></span></p>

<span class="title-prefix">7.7</span> The FAD Template</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s07_p01">The purpose of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">FAD template</a><span class="glossdef">Used to identify the features and attributes that can be used for product and service differentiation.</span></span> is to try to facilitate and provide a degree of structure for conceptualizing new products and services (see <a class="xref" href="sanders_1.0-ch07_s11#sanders_1.0-ch07_s11">Section 7.11 "Exhibit 1: FAD Template"</a>). The first step in using the FAD template is to provide a description of the product or service that is being considered. The second step in using the FAD template involves describing the meaning of the product. Several product meanings have been listed to provide a starting point. The next step in using the FAD template involves identifying potential attributes. The attributes can be features, performance characteristics, form, design, and even additional meanings. We have included a few attributes that are often considered, but you are encouraged to seek the attributes that are important in the development of your product or service. One goal of using the FAD template is to facilitate product differentiation. Focusing on attributes that are exciters and Blue Ocean features will assist in the differentiation process. It is sometimes helpful to focus on features that are on the verge of extinction or features that consumers are not satisfied with or wish they were not there. Considering exciters and disastisfiers helps to expand the way designers view the meaning behind a product or service, and it allows the designer to gain deeper insight into how to improve the current performance of the product.</p>
    <div class="section" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Prototyping and the FAD Template</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_p01">The final stage of using the FAD template is to provide a way to visualize the product by: a drawing, a schematic of the product or service, or a physical model (see several examples in <a class="xref" href="sanders_1.0-ch07_s13#sanders_1.0-ch07_s13">Section 7.13 "Appendix 1: Examples of Prototypes"</a>). Learning-by-doing means that you make and build things. You try experiments and you construct prototypes. Prototypes need to be constructed for tangible products, for services, and also for systems applications. If the product is a tangible product, then a generic mock-up of the product needs to be constructed as early as possible. The idea is to develop a very rough prototype of the product or service. There are many different ways to do this. It could be a report developed in a word-processing program, an interface developed in a presentation program, a sketch using a vector or raster-based drawing program or even drawn using a pencil on the back of a napkin, a three-dimensional (3D) model developed in Google’s free SketchUp program, or a flow diagram illustrating a process. If the product is a computer application, then a prototype can be constructed using a rapid prototyping language or demonstrated via a presentation package such as PowerPoint. There are also many excellent applications available for tablet computers that are very effective for developing mock-ups of applications and for drawing or sketching preliminary product ideas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_p02">Services should also be prototyped. A uniquely designed service can be used as a way to differentiate a firm from the competition. Service design should always focus on the customer and how the customer interacts with the business in receiving the service. These interactions between the customer and the business are referred to as the touch points or connections. There are many components that go into the design of a service. They include the people, the verbal and nonverbal interactions, the processes, the scripts, the tools, the materials, the infrastructure, and the technologies. Execution of the service is a function of how all the service components work together.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_p03">One popular tool for designing services is service <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">blueprinting</a><span class="glossdef">A visual and descriptive tool for modeling visible customer interactions with employees and processes that also illustrates how the hidden processes support the customer interactions.</span></span>. It is a visual and descriptive tool for modeling visible customer interactions with employees and processes that also illustrates how the hidden processes support the customer interactions.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_015">Bitner et al. (2008).</span> There are a number of tools that can be used to conceptualize, design, and test the design of the service including drawings, sketches, scenario analysis and task structuring, mock-ups, storyboarding, systems, Lego mock-ups, and many more (see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.servicedesigntools.org/repository">http://www.servicedesigntools.org/repository</a>). Because services often involve queues or lines, simulations can be used to understand how fast or how slow a service will be performed in a particular situation.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_p04">The goal of the first-cut prototype is to learn-by-doing, to get other people to understand what you are thinking about, and to help you understand what you are trying to do. Developing a prototype in some form or another is an important part of the learning-about and the learning-by-doing process that <em class="emphasis">will</em> facilitate creative insight.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_016">This notion is discussed in the chapter on innovation and is also the result of several research projects I have been involved with. See in particular Cerveny, Garrity, and Sanders (1986).</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_p05">Many prototypes start out with paper and pencil and then become increasingly more sophisticated as they mature. The basic sequence of iterative design with stepwise refinement includes the following: </p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_l01">
            <li>Initial Prototype: In the early stages, develop a pencil and paper picture of the product, the application, or the process. The key is to focus on the key or essential functions of the product or service. </li>
            <li>Review: Let business stakeholders, family, friends, and eventually potential customers provide feedback on the product or service.</li>
            <li>Revise and redesign prototype: Use the feedback to refine and improve the design of the product or service. Use more advanced tools as the prototype becomes more refined and detailed. This usually leads to the use of graphics, drawing, and mock-up software. Towards the later stages of development, the prototype might be a functioning product or service or an actual application with some level of functionality.</li>
            <li>Go back to step 2 after revising and redesigning the prototype.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s07_s01_p06">There are some very exciting prototyping tools for manufactured products. Although currently in their infancy, they have the potential to completely change the way that products are prototyped and eventually how everything will be manufactured.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_017">The Printed World (2011).</span> These new tools are part of a new approach for manufacturing called additive manufacturing or desktop manufacturing. Rapid prototyping is becoming a reality because additive manufacturing assists in producing prototypes very quickly. One of the most promising technologies for implementing additive manufacturing is the 3D printer. Very detailed and complex plastic working models of products can be generated using 3D printers.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_018">In 2011, the 3D printers start at around $10,000 (just search for “3D printers” to see what is currently available.). There are hobbyists versions of 3D printers in the $1,000 range.</span> The parts or products are made by using 3D digital descriptions to print successive thin layers of plastic on top of plastic until a 3D solid emerges. Some of these plastic products and parts can be used as final products and not just as prototypes. There are versions of the 3D printers that use titanium powder to construct very complex objects such as jewelry and avionics components. Several aviation companies are investigating the use of very large 3D printers to create entire aircraft wings. </p>

A merlot can take up to 15 years to age and Shiraz-based wines may require 20 years of aging. Several products have been introduced and patents have been secured and applied for that are purported to speed up the aging process.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_019">Search for “wine aging” at the U.S. patent office and with any search engine.</span> Suppose an inventor found that it was possible to dramatically speed up the wine aging process by exposing a wine to an electromagnetic field with a very specific magnetic field strength. Suppose that the same inventor found that the taste of all wines could be improved using the special aging process.

    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s08_p01">Many innovative products and services are actually complements of the original products. The innovation can be an add-on feature, an after-market service, or a different product or service. Transportation devices have spurred the development of substitute energy sources such as steam, electric, fuel cells, and solar energy. The automobile was the driving force behind the development of better roads, fueling stations, diners, and truck stops. The development of better sailing ships led to the need for complementary devices for navigation tools such as maps, star maps, compasses, sextants, and GPSs. The FAD template and the Strategy Canvas can also be used to identify competitive complementary products and services.</p>

<span class="title-prefix">7.9</span> Avoid the Swiss Army Knife Approach to Product Differentiation</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s09_p01">One model of the Wenger Swiss Army knife, called the <em class="emphasis">Giant</em>, has 87 tools, performs 141 functions, and costs $1,400.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_024"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wengerna.com/giant-knife-16999#">http://www.wengerna.com/giant-knife-16999</a></span> If you were sent to a deserted island and were limited to what you could bring, that knife would certainly be on a short list of must-have items. The Giant was probably introduced because Wenger could introduce it and also because it creates a great image in the mind of consumers. Wenger has excellent engineering skills. In general, however, specialized tools perform better than the all-in-one tool. There is a trade-off between having everything in one place that is readily accessible and having superb capabilities and functionality. The cork-screw, the scissors, the magnifier, the golf club cleaner, and the wire cutter in a Swiss Army knife are OK, but they are not the best tools for doing the respective jobs. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s09_p02">Wireless phones have become the Swiss Army knife for communication, networking, and entertainment. Not all the implements (camera, music playing, video, net interface, retail showroom and purchasing, gaming, GPS, social networking, and communications) are stellar; they are, however, always available to the user. Apple has been very successful at integrating features on the iPhone, the iPad, and their other products that are attractive to their customers, but they are very cautious in adding features for feature sake.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn07_025">Manjoo (2010).</span> Some of the hubris exhibited by Apple is attributable to the cache of the superb Apple brand. But there is a secret sauce for Apple’s success. There are strong design principles at work at Apple, involving minimalism, attention to quality, and focusing on the design of a high-quality user interface. Apple is also very big on attaching meaning to their entire product portfolio. Their commercials exude the development of meaning. The Flip Mino video camera was once very successful because it was simple and very easy to use. The very young and the old are always looking for easy-to-use products and services.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s09_p03"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Feature creep</a><span class="glossdef">Occurs when a new feature is added and many of the old features are retained.</span></span> occurs when a new feature is added and many of the old features are retained. Sometimes features are beneficial. Sometimes they become vestigial and forever encoded in the DNA of the product or service. They are like vestigial physical characteristics in human beings that are no longer needed. For example, humans have tailbones or coccyx, but they do not have tails. Once a feature is in place, it is difficult to remove it because some company will use the features to illustrate how they have more features than their competition. Automobile GPSs illustrate how feature creep occurs over time. Feature creep has been the boom and the boon of companies that produce automobile GPS applications. <a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch07_s09_f01">Figure 7.6 "Features Used to Differentiate GPS Offerings"</a> illustrates the numerous product features that can be found in automobile GPS products. It is unlikely that many people are using the MP3 and photo players on their auto GPSs to play music or view photos, but these features have crept into many of the units sold by GPS manufacturers. The point is that there are instances where it might make sense to scale back on features because the features are either truly vestigial or overkill. This would also reduce the cognitive burden facing consumers because of the numerous choice points. Sometimes the vestigial features hinder design changes and can adversely affect the ability to add new features that are truly valuable to the consumer. One of the greatest impediments facing hardware and software developers in redesigning systems is in maintaining backward compatibility. </p>

<span class="title-prefix">7.10</span> Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s10_p01">Successful product development should involve both UDD that is focused on consumer wants and needs and MDD that is predicated on understanding the emotional and psychological relationships that people have on products as well as incorporating the importance of new technological developments (TDD). We have also introduced the FAD template. The FAD template is based on the various design approaches and also draws on a classification scheme that can be used to ascertain whether attributes and features are increasing or declining in importance. The FAD template in conjunction with the Strategy Canvas can be used to assist in taking an abstract product concept and preparing a first-cut prototype of the product. The key points are the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch07_s10_l01">
        <li>The focus of MDD allows the innovators to develop ideas that transcend existing product concepts, conceiving product ideas as a vision rather than only on product differentiation.</li>
        <li>Concentrating on function and ignoring user input is a recipe for failure.</li>
        <li>Identifying key meanings, attributes, and features is an essential step in MDD, including the customer relationship to the product, quality, reliability, ease-of-use, performance, design, technology, and most importantly, value creation and meaning.</li>
        <li>The meaning of a product or service is very much tied into what the product does.</li>
        <li>Attributes of a product to help users control either their internal or external environments have the power to make a significant impact.</li>
        <li>Psychological ownership of a product promotes user attachment and use, keeping users locked into the product out of loyalty.</li>
        <li>Attending to POPS as well as PODS is necessary to keep your product competitive. POPS ensure that your product meets the minimal essential features. PODS are necessary for distinguishing a product from the competition.</li>
        <li>Disruptive technologies and sunrise features are the dawn of new technological and conceptual capabilities.</li>
        <li>Use the FAD template to facilitate and provide structure when conceptualizing new products and services.</li>
        <li>Create a FAD Strategy Canvas to understand the attributes of your product in the context of your current and potential competitors. </li>
        <li>Seriously consider your feature list in terms of must-haves, points of differentiation, and vestigial features. Try to avoid feature creep, which involves adding features just for the sake of adding new features.</li>
