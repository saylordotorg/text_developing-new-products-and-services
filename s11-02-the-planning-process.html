<span class="title-prefix">8.2</span> The Planning Process</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch08_s02_p01">Planning can be accomplished in a variety of ways. <a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch08_s02_f01">Figure 8.1 "The Planning Process (Adapted from May)"</a> presents a typical model of the strategic planning process.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn08_002">Adapted from May (2010).</span> The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mantra</a><span class="glossdef">An often-repeated phrase that provides the basis for a company’s existence.</span></span> is an often-repeated phrase that provides the basis for the existence of the company. It is a slogan, a watchword, a byword, or a motto that breathes life into the firm’s existence. The mantra is not a replacement for the mission statement. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mission</a><span class="glossdef">An overall view of the business at an abstract level. It describes what the company does, why it exists, and how it satisfes customer needs.</span></span> statement is an overall view of the business at an abstract level. It describes what the company does and why it exists and how it satisfies customer needs. The mission statement can also include a statement reflecting whether the company will focus on product differentiation and niche markets, focus on being price-competitive, or focus on both. The mantra and the mission are rarely static but ever-changing and emerging throughout the life of the firm.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch08_s02_p02">The essence of the planning process consists of looking-inside and looking-outside analysis. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Analysis</a><span class="glossdef">Involves both introspection and extrospection.</span></span> involves both introspection and extrospection. The <em class="emphasis">internal</em> and <em class="emphasis">external</em> organization environments are examined using a number of analytical approaches, several of which are included in <a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch08_s02_t01">Table 8.1 "Orientations of Strategic Planning Approaches"</a>. These techniques will be covered in the next section. There is a lot of confusion related to identifying goals and objectives. Many view the terms goals and objectives to be interchangeable. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Goals</a><span class="glossdef">More abstract and broader than objectives.</span></span> are more abstract and broader than objectives. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Objectives</a><span class="glossdef">More detailed than goals.</span></span> are generally more detailed. The important point that will be discussed in the next chapter is to identify the goals and objectives that will help support the mantra, the mission, and the value proposition over a certain time frame. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tactics</a><span class="glossdef">The activities the organization will use over the next three months to a year to reach their goals and objectives.</span></span> are the activities the organization will use over the next 3 months to a year to reach their goals and objectives. The tactics can include timetables and schedules related to the goals and objectives. The key to the model in <a class="xref" href="#sanders_1.0-ch08_s02_f01">Figure 8.1 "The Planning Process (Adapted from May)"</a> is that this is not a linear process. Sometimes a new mission emerges after analysis has been completed. Mission statements that change, reflect an organization that can adapt to dynamic environments. </p>
