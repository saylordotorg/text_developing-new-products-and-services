<span class="title-prefix">11.1</span> Why are Businesses Bought and Sold? </h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch11_s01_p01">A major reason why businesses are bought is that parties interested in beginning or expanding business activity often prefer acquiring an existing business rather than starting a new one. Existing businesses are “up and running,” and have in place a product or service line, a work force, customers, suppliers, the necessary physical resources, and various intangibles—technology and “know-how,” systems and procedures, location, reputation, and the like.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch11_s01_p02">From a seller’s perspective, business owners need to have an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">exit strategy</a><span class="glossdef">A means of extracting value from business owners’ investments of time and resources in the business.</span></span>, a means of extracting value from their investments of time and resources in the business. A sale may be occasioned by the death or intended retirement of the owner, or by a desire to “cash out” the investment at a time when its value is perceived to be high. Or, an owner may wish to expand the business by taking on new partners, selling a portion of ownership to new parties. Sometimes this is done to reward and retain key personnel by offering them an ownership interest in the business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch11_s01_p03">Even when no transfer of ownership is involved, a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business valuation</a><span class="glossdef">Determines the estimated market value of a business entity.</span></span> may be done when seeking major new financing. A valuation provides the prospective lender with an indication of the safety of a loan secured by the business. </p>
