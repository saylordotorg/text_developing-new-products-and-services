<span class="title-prefix">8.4</span> Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch08_s04_p01">In this chapter, we have reviewed many popular approaches for strategic planning. The key points are the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch08_s04_l01">
        <li>The two basic strategies for business planning include product differentiation and striving to be the low-cost producer.</li>
        <li>Product differentiation can be accomplished by focusing on Midas versions of products using extravagant engineering and design. Being the low-cost producer can be accomplished by focusing on Hermes versions of products using frugal engineering and design.</li>
        <li>Planning approaches can be classified as having an internal organizational focus (looking inside) or an external or environmental focus (looking outside).</li>
        <li>The development of an abbreviated SWOT analysis that is supported with a strategy analysis can be used to integrate the key attributes of the various strategic planning approaches.</li>
        <li>The planning process never ends. With continuous pressure from market and competition, firms are suggested to develop new strategy and planning from time to time. </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch08_s04_p02">This chapter reviewed the various analytic approaches for strategic planning. There is no single business plan that can be used to deal with the complexity of monopolistic competition nor is there a single planning approach that will take the organization down the right path. A revised analysis tool, called quick SWOT analysis, was introduced that combines the various strategic planning approaches. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch08_s04_p03">This chapter also sets the stage for the Ten–Ten planning process, a simplified yet robust approach to planning. The next chapter will present two templates for developing a business plan. The first template is the Organizational and Industry Analysis template and it incorporates the quick SWOT approach along with concepts from value chain analysis, the resource-based approach, Blue Ocean market analysis, and the other strategic analysis approaches discussed in this chapter. This information is then used to fill in the Business Plan Overview template. The use of the two templates is part of the Ten–Ten planning process. The approach can be used to produce one plan and also to churn out new plans in order to compete in dynamic environments characterized by monopolistic competition. </p>
