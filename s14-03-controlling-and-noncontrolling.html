<span class="title-prefix">11.3</span> Controlling and Noncontrolling Interests</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch11_s03_p01">One consideration in determining the value of a business ownership interest is the extent to which that interest can exercise <em class="emphasis">control</em> over business activity. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Control</a><span class="glossdef">The power to direct the policies and management of the business.</span></span> refers to the power to direct the policies and management of the business. Control is most commonly measured by voting power—holding more than 50% of the voting equity of the company. In some cases, when there is no majority stockholder, other circumstances can lead to one owner having effective control. </p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch11_s03_p02">When there is a controlling interest, other ownership interests are said to be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">minority</a><span class="glossdef">Interests that represent less than 50 percent of the voting power in the company.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">noncontrolling interests</a><span class="glossdef">Interests that represent less than 50 percent of the voting power in the company.</span></span>. Such interests represent 50% of the voting power in the company. A voting interest of exactly 50% is neither a controlling nor a minority interest. While a 50% interest cannot cause things to happen, it can prevent things from happening. Having two 50% owners is often considered an inefficient business structure, as a stalemate occurs if the two owners do not agree. However, that structure—<em class="emphasis">shared control</em>—appears in many joint ventures.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch11_s03_p03">A controlling interest is generally considered to be worth more, on a per-share basis, than a noncontrolling interest. Among the powers of a controlling interest are the abilities to:<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn11_004">Pratt (2001).</span></p>

        <li>enter into contracts with suppliers, customers, and others;</li>
        <li>determine the existence and amount of dividends;</li>
        <li>decide on acquisition and disposition of assets;</li>
        <li>determine the financing and capital structure of the company.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch11_s03_p04">A controlling owner has different options for disposing of the investment (<em class="emphasis">exit</em>) or converting it to cash (<em class="emphasis">liquidity</em>) than does a noncontrolling owner. The controlling owner’s <em class="emphasis">exit or liquidity options</em> include selling the controlling interest, taking the company public, or deciding to liquidate the business. The noncontrolling owner’s exit or liquidity options include selling to the controlling owner or selling to another noncontrolling owner. When a buyer does not exist, the noncontrolling owner effectively has no exit option. Continuing to hold the investment is a liquidity option to the extent that the business pays dividends.</p>
