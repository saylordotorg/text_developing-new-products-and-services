<span class="title-prefix">6.5</span> How to Hinder Creativity</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch06_s06_p01">The first way to hinder creativity is to reduce thinking time and try to eliminate solitude. Management can accomplish this in six easy steps:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch06_s06_l01">
        <li>Schedule many meetings. In addition to weekly project meetings, schedule daily meetings to solve all kinds of problems and to show off what has been accomplished.</li>
        <li>Have each team member account for all of his or her time in detail.</li>
        <li>Tell people not to talk to each other about their tasks. </li>
        <li>Interrupt individuals whenever possible. Give team members new tasks to accomplish. If problems arise on other projects, then send them over to help out.</li>
        <li>Change the product specifications and put in new features at the last minute.</li>
        <li>Have the team members stay at work 12 hours per day and have them work on weekends.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="sanders_1.0-ch06_s06_p02">Lack of time and interruptions are enemies of the creative process. Creativity is diminished when individuals are under-the-gun and the workdays are fragmented with many meetings, with busy work and interruptions.<span class="footnote" id="sanders_1.0-fn06_019">Amabile et al. (2002).</span> Creativity is not very efficient. It takes time to understand a problem and to develop ideas. </p>
